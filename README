NAME
       dwm - dynamic window manager (Ahmed Sami <ahmedsami03@protonmail.com>'s
       build)

SYNOPSIS
       dwm [-v]

DESCRIPTION
       dwm is a dynamic window manager for X.

       dwm "orders" windows based on recency and primacy,  while  dwm  layouts
       may change, the most recent "master" window is shown in the most promi‐
       nent position. There are bindings for  cycling  through  and  promoting
       windows to the master position.

       Windows are grouped by tags. Each window can be tagged with one or mul‐
       tiple tags. Selecting certain tags  displays  all  windows  with  these
       tags.

       Each  screen  contains  a small status bar which displays all available
       tags, the layout, the title of the focused window, and  the  text  read
       from  the root window name property, if the screen is focused. A float‐
       ing window is indicated with an empty square and a  maximised  floating
       window is indicated with a filled square before the windows title.  The
       selected tags are indicated with a different color. The tags of the fo‐
       cused window are indicated with a filled square in the top left corner.
       The tags which are applied to one or more windows are indicated with an
       empty square in the top left corner.

       dwm draws a small border around windows to indicate the focus state.

       ~/.local/bin/  is  the  path  to  my helper scripts. You can find theme
       here: https://github.com/add1609/artixrice/.local/bin/

       libxft-bgra-git should be installed for this build of dwm.  Arch  users
       may install it via the AUR. Color characters and emoji are enabled, but
       these will cause crashes without the fix libxft-bgra-git offers.
